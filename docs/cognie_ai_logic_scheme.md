# Cognie AI Logic Schemes - Comprehensive User Flow

## 1. Core AI Engine Logic Flow

### A. User Context Understanding Engine
```
User Input → Context Analysis → Profile Matching → Personalized Response

Context Factors:
- Current time/day
- User type (student/founder/creator)
- Energy level patterns
- Historical completion rates
- Current goal priorities
- Upcoming deadlines
```

### B. Smart Decision Tree
```
Task Request → [Is Urgent?] → [Check Capacity] → [Energy Match?] → [Schedule/Defer/Delegate]
                     ↓              ↓             ↓
                Priority Level → Available Slots → Energy Assessment → Final Placement
```

## 2. Onboarding & Initial Setup Logic

### A. Smart Onboarding Flow
```
1. Welcome → User Type Detection → Personalization Quiz → Feature Introduction → First Goal Setup

Decision Points:
- If student: Focus on study schedules, exam tracking, revision plans
- If founder: Emphasize goal tracking, meeting management, project balance
- If creator: Highlight creative blocks, inspiration tracking, content planning
```

### B. Profile Building Logic
```python
# Pseudo-code for profile initialization
def initialize_user_profile(user_responses):
    if user_type == "student":
        enable_features = ["flashcards", "exam_scheduler", "study_blocks"]
        default_focus_hours = "9AM-5PM"
        energy_pattern = "morning_peak"
    elif user_type == "founder":
        enable_features = ["goal_tracking", "meeting_blocks", "reflection_prompts"]
        default_focus_hours = "6AM-10AM, 2PM-6PM"
        energy_pattern = "early_bird_night_owl"
    
    return create_adaptive_profile(enable_features, default_focus_hours, energy_pattern)
```

## 3. Daily AI Logic Workflows

### A. Morning Brief Generation (`/daily-brief`)
```
1. Analyze yesterday's completion rate
2. Check today's calendar conflicts
3. Assess energy prediction based on historical data
4. Generate prioritized task list
5. Create motivational message based on recent patterns
6. Suggest optimal task order

Logic Tree:
- If completion rate < 70% yesterday → Reduce today's load by 20%
- If high-energy day predicted → Schedule deep work first
- If calendar packed → Suggest task batching
- If streak broken → Include gentle encouragement
```

### B. Real-time Rescheduling Logic (`/suggest-reschedule`)
```
Missed Task Detected → Analyze Reason → Calculate New Priority → Find Optimal Slot → Notify User

Rescheduling Intelligence:
1. Pattern Recognition: Why was it missed?
   - Time estimation error → Adjust future estimates
   - Energy mismatch → Move to better energy slot
   - External interruption → Add buffer time
   - Lost motivation → Break into smaller tasks

2. Smart Placement:
   - Respect energy patterns
   - Consider deadline proximity
   - Account for task dependencies
   - Minimize calendar disruption
```

## 4. Learning & Memory Engine Logic

### A. Flashcard Generation (`/generate-flashcards`)
```
Text Input → Content Analysis → Key Concept Extraction → Question Generation → Difficulty Assessment

AI Processing Steps:
1. Parse input text (notes, textbook content, URLs)
2. Identify key concepts using NLP
3. Generate question-answer pairs
4. Assess difficulty based on:
   - Concept complexity
   - User's previous performance
   - Subject matter expertise level
5. Create spaced repetition schedule
```

### B. Spaced Repetition Logic (`/review/plan`)
```python
def calculate_review_schedule(flashcard_performance):
    if performance == "correct":
        next_review = current_interval * 2.5
    elif performance == "difficult":
        next_review = current_interval * 1.3
    elif performance == "wrong":
        next_review = 1  # Review tomorrow
    
    return adjust_for_exam_proximity(next_review)
```

## 5. Goal-Aligned Planning Logic

### A. Task Prioritization Algorithm
```
Goal Alignment Score = (Goal Importance × Task Contribution) + Urgency Factor + Energy Match

Calculation:
- Goal Importance: 1-10 scale set by user
- Task Contribution: AI-assessed relevance to goal (0.1-1.0)
- Urgency Factor: Deadline pressure (0.1-2.0)
- Energy Match: Task type vs. current energy level (0.5-1.5)

Final Priority = (Goal Alignment Score × User Consistency Factor) + Streak Bonus
```

### B. Dynamic Goal Adjustment
```
Weekly Goal Review → Progress Analysis → Obstacle Identification → Goal Refinement

Logic:
- If consistently missing goal tasks → Suggest goal scope reduction
- If completing ahead of schedule → Suggest goal expansion
- If avoiding specific task types → Investigate and suggest alternatives
- If energy patterns changed → Adjust goal timing
```

## 6. Integration Logic Flows

### A. Notion Sync Logic (`/notion-sync`)
```
1. Webhook Received → Validate Source → Parse Changes → Map to Cognie Structure → Update Local DB → Sync Conflicts Resolution

Conflict Resolution:
- Cognie edit + Notion edit → Present options to user
- Deleted in Notion but active in Cognie → Confirm deletion
- New in Notion → Auto-import with smart categorization
- Status mismatch → Use most recent timestamp
```

### B. Calendar Integration Logic
```
External Calendar Event → Time Block Analysis → Conflict Detection → Buffer Suggestion → Auto-reschedule Affected Tasks

Smart Scheduling:
- Meeting added → Automatically move focus tasks to earlier/later
- Travel time detected → Add buffer periods
- Recurring events → Learn patterns and pre-block time
- Free time found → Suggest task filling
```

## 7. AI Personalization Logic

### A. Adaptive Learning System
```python
def update_user_patterns(user_id, action_data):
    current_patterns = get_user_patterns(user_id)
    
    # Energy pattern learning
    if action_data.task_completed:
        energy_effectiveness[action_data.time_slot] += 0.1
    else:
        energy_effectiveness[action_data.time_slot] -= 0.05
    
    # Task estimation learning
    actual_duration = action_data.actual_time
    estimated_duration = action_data.estimated_time
    
    if actual_duration > estimated_duration * 1.2:
        task_estimation_multiplier += 0.1
    elif actual_duration < estimated_duration * 0.8:
        task_estimation_multiplier -= 0.05
    
    return updated_patterns
```

### B. Burnout Prevention Logic
```
Stress Indicators Detection → Early Warning → Intervention Suggestions

Monitoring:
- Task completion rate decline (>20% drop)
- Increased rescheduling frequency
- Late-night activity patterns
- Shortened task durations
- Reduced goal engagement

Interventions:
- Suggest lighter day
- Recommend breaks
- Propose goal adjustment
- Encourage reflection
- Offer motivational content
```

## 8. Feature Flag Integration Logic

### A. Dynamic Feature Availability
```python
def check_feature_access(user, feature_name):
    # Check global feature flags
    feature_flag = get_feature_flag(feature_name)
    
    if not feature_flag.is_globally_enabled:
        return False
    
    # Check user-specific conditions
    if feature_flag.target_user_types:
        if user.type not in feature_flag.target_user_types:
            return False
    
    # Check rollout percentage
    if feature_flag.rollout_percentage < 100:
        user_hash = hash(f"{user.id}_{feature_name}")
        if (user_hash % 100) >= feature_flag.rollout_percentage:
            return False
    
    return True
```

## 9. Error Handling & Recovery Logic

### A. Graceful Degradation
```
AI Service Unavailable → Fallback to Rule-based Logic → Maintain Core Functionality

Fallbacks:
- AI planning fails → Use template-based scheduling
- Flashcard generation fails → Allow manual creation
- Insights unavailable → Show basic statistics
- Integration down → Queue sync for later
```

### B. Data Consistency Logic
```
Sync Conflict → Analyze Timestamps → Apply Resolution Rules → Log for Review

Resolution Priority:
1. User explicit changes (highest)
2. Recent automated updates
3. External integrations
4. System-generated defaults (lowest)
```

## 10. Notification & Engagement Logic

### A. Smart Notification Timing
```python
def calculate_optimal_notification_time(user, notification_type):
    user_patterns = get_user_activity_patterns(user.id)
    
    if notification_type == "daily_brief":
        return user_patterns.typical_start_time - 30_minutes
    elif notification_type == "task_reminder":
        return task.scheduled_time - calculate_prep_buffer(task.complexity)
    elif notification_type == "review_flashcards":
        return find_next_break_in_schedule(user.calendar)
    
    return optimize_for_engagement(user_patterns, notification_type)
```

### B. Engagement Scoring
```
Engagement Score = (Actions_Taken / Notifications_Sent) × Retention_Factor × Feature_Usage_Breadth

Dynamic Adjustment:
- High engagement → Increase feature suggestions
- Low engagement → Simplify interface, reduce noise
- Medium engagement → A/B test new features
```

## 11. Analytics & Insights Logic

### A. Pattern Recognition Engine
```python
def generate_weekly_insights(user_id):
    week_data = get_user_week_data(user_id)
    insights = []
    
    # Productivity patterns
    if detect_pattern("overbooking_tuesdays", week_data):
        insights.append(create_insight("overbooking", "tuesday", suggestion="reduce_tuesday_load"))
    
    # Energy optimization
    optimal_times = find_peak_performance_windows(week_data)
    if optimal_times != user.current_focus_hours:
        insights.append(create_insight("energy_optimization", optimal_times))
    
    # Goal progress
    goal_progress = calculate_goal_momentum(week_data)
    insights.append(create_insight("goal_progress", goal_progress))
    
    return prioritize_insights(insights)
```

## 12. Command Palette Logic (`/ai-command`)

### A. Natural Language Processing
```
User Input → Intent Classification → Entity Extraction → Action Mapping → Execution

Examples:
- "Plan 3 hours of study time this week" → Schedule study blocks
- "Move tomorrow's meeting to Thursday" → Reschedule task
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed" → Suggest workload reduction
- "Quiz me on Chapter 5" → Generate flashcard session
```

### B. Context-Aware Responses
```python
def process_ai_command(user_input, user_context):
    intent = classify_intent(user_input)
    
    if intent == "scheduling":
        return handle_scheduling_request(user_input, user_context.calendar)
    elif intent == "learning":
        return handle_learning_request(user_input, user_context.study_materials)
    elif intent == "productivity":
        return handle_productivity_request(user_input, user_context.current_goals)
    
    return generate_contextual_response(user_input, user_context)
```
