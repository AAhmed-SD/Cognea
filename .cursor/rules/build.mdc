name No Back and Forth Just Build  
trigger any prompt  
rules  
  when writing code or generating files  
    do  
      Assume I want you to complete the task without asking follow up questions  
      Use best practices and sensible defaults where there is ambiguity  
      Do not pause to ask for clarification unless absolutely necessary  
      Focus on outputting working clean production ready code with brief inline comments  
      Prioritize speed and execution I will review and edit later if needed  
      If multiple approaches exist choose the most straightforward and modular one
