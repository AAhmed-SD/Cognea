## Completed Tasks
- Improved error handling in `generate_openai_text` by returning structured error responses.
- Added token usage reporting in the OpenAI integration.
- Enhanced logging granularity with more logging levels.
- Suggested a clean directory structure for separating frontend and backend.

## Next Steps
- Implement the suggested directory structure by moving frontend and backend files into separate directories.
- Test the FastAPI server to ensure it runs without errors after installing missing packages.
- Continue with any remaining tasks on the to-do list, focusing on resolving any blockers and ensuring the application is stable.

## FastAPI Endpoints Plan

### AI Tasks & Memory
- `/generate-flashcards`: Turn raw notes or textbook content into flashcards.
- `/daily-brief`: Generate a daily summary of tasks, priorities, missed tasks, and a reflection.
- `/quiz-me`: Takes a deck ID, returns 3‚Äì5 Qs from that deck to quiz the user.
- `/summarize-notes`: Compress long notes into key takeaways.
- `/suggest-reschedule`: Suggest new time + reasoning for missed task.
- `/extract-tasks-from-text`: User brain-dumps a paragraph, AI extracts structured tasks.

### Planning
- `/plan-my-day`: Auto-generate time blocks for a day.
- `/goals`: Create and track high-level goals.
- `/schedule`: Manage scheduled blocks.

### Memory Engine
- `/flashcards`: CRUD operations for flashcards.

### Insights
- `/user-insights`: Return trends, missed patterns, overbooking, etc.
- `/ai-feedback`: GPT reviews your week.

### Utility + UX
- `/notifications`: Basic create/delete for reminders.
- `/settings`: Save user energy preferences, focus hours, etc.

### Integration
- `/notion-sync`: Push/pull tasks and notes from Notion.

### Command UX (stretch)
- `/ai-command`: One endpoint for command-palette prompts.
