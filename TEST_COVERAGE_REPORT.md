## Current Coverage Statistics

### High Coverage Modules (>80%)
- **services/review_engine.py**: 100%
- **services/openai_integration.py**: 88%
- **services/ai_cache.py**: 84%
- **services/email_service.py**: 81%

### Medium Coverage Modules (50-80%)
- **services/redis_cache.py**: 56%
- **services/notion/notion_client.py**: 58%

### Areas Needing Improvement
Several modules still require additional test coverage:
- **services/auth_service.py**: 0% (needs comprehensive auth testing)
- **services/background_tasks.py**: 0% (needs async task testing)
- **services/celery_app.py**: 0% (needs Celery integration testing)
- **services/monitoring.py**: 0% (needs monitoring and metrics testing)
- **services/performance.py**: 0% (needs performance testing)

## Test Quality Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added tests for all major exception scenarios
- Network failure simulation
- Database error handling
- Invalid input validation

### 2. Edge Case Coverage
- Empty and null value handling
- Boundary value testing
- Concurrent operation testing
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

### 3. Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Cross-service interaction testing
- Real-world usage pattern simulation

### 4. Mock Strategy
- Proper isolation of external dependencies
- Realistic mock responses
- Error condition simulation
- Performance characteristic testing

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Test Failures
Some tests are currently failing due to:
- Mock configuration mismatches with actual service interfaces
- Async/await pattern inconsistencies
- Environment setup requirements

### 2. Missing Test Infrastructure
- Need better test fixtures for database mocking
- Improved async test utilities
- More realistic mock data generators

### 3. Performance Testing
