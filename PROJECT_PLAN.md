# Project Plan for FocusFlow

## Overview
FocusFlow is an AI-powered scheduling and productivity tool designed to help students and planners manage tasks, goals, and schedules efficiently. The application integrates with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Notion, offering features like AI-synced scheduling, memory-aware task reviews, and dynamic rescheduling.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **AI/LLM Integration**: OpenAI API or local model via LangChain/LLMGuard
- **Memory Store**: Redis (short-term) + PostgreSQL (long-term structured memories)
- **Vector Store**: Weaviate or Qdrant
- **Scheduling/Tasks**: Celery with Redis or FastAPI BackgroundTasks

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: Zustand or TanStack Query
- **Realtime Sync**: Socket.IO or Pusher (optional)

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage or Backblaze B2
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Railway built-ins

### Auth, Payments, and Analytics
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth or Clerk.dev
- **Payments**: Stripe with metered billing or fixed tier plans
- **Analytics**: PostHog, Umami, or Plausible

## GCP Integration Plan
- **Compute Engine**: For running virtual machines and hosting backend services.
- **App Engine**: For building and deploying applications.
- **Cloud Storage**: For storing files and assets.
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed database service for PostgreSQL.
- **Cloud Functions**: For serverless execution of code.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Use AI Platform for training and deploying models.
- **Cloud Pub/Sub**: For messaging and event-driven architectures.

## Next Steps
1. **Set Up GCP Account**: Ensure GCP account is set up and familiarize with the GCP Console.
2. **Configure Environment**: Integrate development environment with GCP services.
3. **Deploy Application**: Begin deploying backend services to GCP.
4. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use GCP's monitoring tools to track performance and optimize the application.

This plan outlines the comprehensive approach to building and deploying FocusFlow, leveraging modern technologies and GCP's robust infrastructure.
